## About me:

I'm a computer science major at California State University, Fullerton. I can use HTML/CSS, C++, Javascript, and Python (Python is my favourite), and am making my own website from scratch in my free time (sorry, but my website-made-from-scratch is still a work in progress, so I've provided my in-the-meantime one below).

I recently fell in love with cybersecurity and am teaching myself however I can, using online resources like TryHackMe, Hack the Box, and whatever else I can find on the internet. I'm always open to learning new things and can always use a little more advice.

I'm interested in any opportunities that come my way and see them as a chance to develop more experience. Feel free to reach out!
