## About me:

I'm a computer science grad from California State University, Fullerton. I can use a number of programming languages, and am making my own website from scratch in my free time (still a work in progress).

I recently fell in love with cybersecurity and am teaching myself however I can, using online resources like TryHackMe, Hack the Box, and whatever else I can find on the internet. I'm always open to learning new things and can always use a little more advice.

I'm interested in any opportunities that come my way and see them as a chance to develop more experience. Feel free to reach out!
